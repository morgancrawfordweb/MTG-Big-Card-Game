    <h2 class="title">Planeschase</h2>
    <span>This game is played more like a normal game, with the effects of</span>
    <p><b>Shared planar deck</b> Start a multiplayer game and reveal the top card of the shared planar deck. That is the plane that everybody is on, and its effects apply to all players. During each player's main phase, they may roll the six-sided planar die for a chance to take an action: If it lands on the planeswalker symbol the players must planeswalk and move on to the next plane - put the current plane on the bottom of the planar deck and reveal the next one.

        If it lands on the Chaos symbol, that player must trigger the Chaos ability of the plane. The first roll each turn is free, but if the player wants to roll the planar die more than once, they must pay (1) additional for each dice roll - the second roll each turn costs (1), the third roll costs (2), and so on.</p>
        
        <img class="rules-plane" src ='https://images.ctfassets.net/s5n2t79q9icq/36q7Rc18odPjGhMArwGfXR/9b7c3340bfebcca2a3a81214b2af8d55/I21730v5eZu_EN.png'>
        
        <p>Individual planar deck: The first player gets to reveal the first plane from their own deck, and when anybody rolls the planeswalker symbol, they move on to the top plane of their own Planar deck. All other rules remain the same.
        
        -A shared planar deck must contain at least 40 cards, or at least 10 times the number of players in the game, whichever number is smaller.

        -A shared planar deck also cannot contain more phenomenon cards than <b>2 times</b> the number of players in the game.

        -Individual planar decks should contain at least 10 cards, including no more than 2 phenomenon cards. Either way, each card in a Planar deck must have a different name - you may not have multiple copies of the same plane or phenomenon in the same Planar deck.</p>

  <section class="rules how-to">
    <p>This application will allow you to play planeschase while choosing which plane you get to walk to after the roll! This lessens the randomization, and can reward the player who wins the roll to planeswalk. The plane you are on will be enlarged in the middle of your device, several planes will be smaller and surround your current plane. These are the top ____ planes from the deck, in which you get to pick where you want to go next. Each of these planes will be randomized. See the example below for details!</p>
