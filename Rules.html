  <h2 class="title">Basic MTG Rules</h2>
  <section class="rules">
      <p>Magic the gathering is a very complicated game, and takes a while to be familiar with the game. Whatever you do, dont feel bad if you dont understand something, most players will be helpful when it comes to game mechanics. The community is typically very friendly! The rules on this page will be tell players how to play Planeschase and Archenemy format, if you would like a comprehesive list of how each MTG(Magic The Gathering) phase works, <a href='https://magic.wizards.com/en/how-to-play'>use this link</a> to find all a more detailed description of the rules!</p>
  </section>
  <h2 class="title">Planeschase</h2>
  <section class = 'rules'>
    <p>This game is played more like a normal game, with the effects of a
    <b>Shared planar deck</b>. Start a multiplayer game and reveal the top card of the shared planar deck. That is the plane that everybody is on, and its effects apply to all players. During each player's main phase, they may roll the six-sided planar die for a chance to take an action: If it lands on the planeswalker symbol the players must planeswalk and move on to the next plane - put the current plane on the bottom of the planar deck and reveal the next one.</p>

        <p>If it lands on the Chaos symbol, that player must trigger the Chaos ability of the plane. The first roll each turn is free, but if the player wants to roll the planar die more than once, they must pay (1) additional for each dice roll - the second roll each turn costs (1), the third roll costs (2), and so on.</p>
        
        <img class="rules-plane" src ='https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/9/9/99ee3cd9-321e-4dfa-a144-65854d914d84.jpg?1547432239'><br>
        
        <p>Individual planar deck: The first player gets to reveal the first plane from their own deck, and when anybody rolls the planeswalker symbol, they move on to the top plane of their own Planar deck. All other rules remain the same.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A shared planar deck must contain at least 40 cards, or at least 10 times the number of players in the game, whichever number is smaller.</li>

        <li>A shared planar deck also cannot contain more phenomenon cards than <b>2 times</b> the number of players in the game.</li>

        <li>Individual planar decks should contain at least 10 cards, including no more than 2 phenomenon cards. Either way, each card in a Planar deck must have a different name - you may not have multiple copies of the same plane or phenomenon in the same Planar deck.</li>
        </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="rules how-to">
    <p>This application will allow you to play planeschase while choosing which plane you get to walk to after the roll! This lessens the randomization, and can reward the player who wins the roll to planeswalk. The plane you are on will be  in the center and enlarged in the middle of your device, several planes will be smaller and surround your current plane. These are the top 4 planes from the deck, in which you get to pick where you want to go next. Each of these planes will be randomized. See the example below for details!</p>

  <h2 class="title">Archenemy</h2>
  <section class = 'rules'>
    <p>
      Archenemy is a casual multiplayer format designed for "one vs. many" gameplay. In an Archenemy game, one player takes on the titular role and uses an increased life total and a deck of non-traditional scheme cards to play against a team of variable size.<br></br>
      
      Scheme cards are exclusively available in products dedicated to the format, including Archenemy and Archenemy: Nicol Bolas.<br></br>

      One player, designated the archenemy, plays against a team of opponents. To even the odds, the archenemy starts the game with 40 life, always takes the first turn, and keeps a second deck of oversized and powerful scheme cards in the command zone. The opposing team takes a simultaneous turn, as in Two-Headed Giant, but each player on that team has a separate life total of 20. Any teammates can block an attacker declared by the archenemy, regardless of which player is being attacked.<br></br>
The archenemy wins if all other players are eliminated from the game. All of the opposing players, even those who have already left the game, win if the archenemy loses.<br></br>
At the beginning of each of the archenemy's precombat main phases, they draw the top card of their scheme deck, leaving it face up in the command zone, and "set [it] in motion". Schemes, like emblems, are not permanents. Most schemes have a triggered ability which triggers immediately upon being set in motion. However, schemes with the Ongoing supertype have an additional static ability, as well as triggered abilities which cause them to be "abandoned". Whenever a scheme is "done" (resolved or abandoned), it is placed on the bottom of the scheme deck. The scheme deck is not shuffled after the start of the game.<br></br>

</section>

<p>Archenemy also offers a "Supervillain Rumble" variant. In that variant, each player controls a scheme deck, starts at 40 life, and may attack all other players in a Free-for-All. The starting player is randomly chosen.
